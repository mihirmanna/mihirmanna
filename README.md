<h3 align="center"> 🚀 Physics & Astronomy Student @ UW-Madison 🔭 </h3>

I'm majoring in physics and astronomy at UW-Madison, as well as pursuing certificates in computer science and mathematics. My interests lie at the intersection of computation and physics--and as a teacher, I'm always looking to drive greater accessibility in both fields.

## 👨‍💻 Projects
Although most of my programming classes to date have been taught using Java, I've had the opportunity to explore other coding languages either through work or on my own. Some of my featured projects are listed below.

### Python
* [PAM Parser](https://github.com/mihirmanna/pam-parser)
### Java
* Arithmetic Calculator
* Graphing Calculator
* Linear Equation Solver
* Mandelbrot Set Visualization
### JavaScript
* Projectile Motion Simulation
* Billiards Simulation
### C#
* [Volley Pong](https://github.com/mihirmanna/volley-pong)
