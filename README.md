<h3 align="center"> Physics & Astronomy-Physics Student @ UW-Madison </h3>

I'm majoring in physics and astronomy-physics at UW-Madison, as well as pursuing undergraduate certificates (minors) in computer science and mathematics. My interests lie at the intersection of computation and physics--and as a teacher, I'm always looking to drive greater understanding in both fields. If you'd like to connect, please feel free to reach out!
